To run the speedrun, copy the two .lua-files and the .dat-file to a new folder 
in the factorio scenarios folder, then go into the game -> play -> scenarios 
and pick the name you gave the folder (it will appear under "User scenarios:").

The run will stall when the first technology is researched, unless you go into
the game options -> other and disable "Technology window opens when research
is completed".
